# IntroToAlgorithms-Java
Java implementations of classic algorithms from the book Introduction to Algorithms (CLRS).

Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This repository is a personal project I created to help me truly understand the core of computer science: **algorithms**.

Iâ€™ve decided to go back to the basics and study one of the most iconic books in the field â€” *Introduction to Algorithms*, also known as **CLRS**. But instead of just reading or watching tutorials, Iâ€™m doing something more powerful: **implementing every important algorithm by hand**, in Java.

I'm going chapter by chapter, slowly and mindfully. No shortcuts.  
Every class, every method here was written from scratch, as a way to make the knowledge stick.

Sometimes I take notes. Sometimes I make mistakes. But thatâ€™s the point.  
This is not a polished library. This is my personal **algorithm notebook**, a kind of digital journal where I code what I learn.

Youâ€™ll find things like:

- Sorting algorithms I wrote after studying their time complexities.
- Graph traversal algorithms that I coded after sketching graphs on paper.
- Dynamic programming problems that made my brain hurt (in a good way).
- Data structures built from zero to understand how they work internally.

Iâ€™ll keep updating this repo as I move forward.  
Itâ€™s a slow burn, but itâ€™s real learning.

If youâ€™re also learning algorithms â€” welcome.  
Feel free to explore the code, fork it, or even start your own version of this idea.

Thanks for reading.  
Letâ€™s keep learning. ðŸ§ ðŸ’»
